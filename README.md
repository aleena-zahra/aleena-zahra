# 👋 Hi, I’m Aleena Zahra

🎓 I'm a Data Science undergrad based in Islamabad, passionate about using code to explore big, complex questions—especially at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and human behavior.

🔬  I’m actively building my foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and scientific thinking—one project at a time. My goal? To contribute to research that helps us understand how we think, feel, and make decisions.


## 🧠 Current Interests
- Machine Learning & AI (especially interpretability & real-world applications)
- Brain-computer interfaces (BCI), cognitive modeling, and neuroAI (exploring soon!)
- Data visualization as a tool for insight and storytelling
- Interactive media: games, simulations, and educational tech

## 🌱 What I’m Building

-  Data Projects exploring brain imaging and brain patterns
-  A CGPA predictor for univeristy students based on machine learning models and mlrm



## 📌 What’s More

I'm looking for internships and research roles where I can:
- Work with machine learning in real-world or research settings  
- Learn from mentors and contribute meaningfully to a team  
- Explore the messy, exciting overlap of brains + algorithms  

If your lab, company, or team is working on anything in that spirit—**let’s connect**.
